                "If Ataturk had lived today the world would have been a more interesting place. 
                When, in 1915, during our ill-fated Dardanelles campaign fate brought us across in Gallipoli we immediately knew that we were up against a military genius 
                and a formidable strategist. Soon he emerged as a noble warrior.  Later he proved himself as a genuine peace-maker and a consummate statesman as well."
                <br>

            <br>
            <p><em>
                "Ataturk, with his historic achievements, was one of the greatest leaders of this century (20th). 
                He was a towering figure of human ideals. His extraordinary leadership and his military genius accomplished so much for his country; first in battlefields,
                 and then in building his nation, materially and in spirit.  He created a modern and sovereign state from the ashes of a defeated empire. 
                 He was a great peace-maker, 
                an ultimate reformer and a torch-bearer of freedom. He won not only the heart of his nation but the hearts of the oppressed nations as well. We all miss him."

                "Because of the 25th year of Atatürk's death, I want to express the feelings of loyal friendship felt for the Turkish nation by the French nation. 
                Today, Turkish history even more than ever is inseparable from Western and European history. Atatürk's efforts in this direction were not left without results. 
                The friendship between our countries that has surpassed hundreds of years, has formed the foundation for this development."
